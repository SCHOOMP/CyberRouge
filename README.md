CyberRogue is a fast-paced roguelike set in a neon-drenched cyberpunk world where every run is a fight for survival against ruthless megacorp enforcers, rogue AI, and underground syndicates. As a skilled cyber-runner, you navigate procedurally generated city sectors, hacking systems, upgrading cybernetic implants, and mastering an arsenal of high-tech weaponry.

With each run, you scavenge for upgrades, uncover dark conspiracies, and push deeper into the digital underworld, knowing that permadeath means starting overâ€”but stronger and wiser. Will you escape the cityâ€™s iron grip, or will you become another ghost in the machine?
